## 🔄 Current Implementation

### Demo Mode (Active Now)

The addon currently runs in **demo mode** with **simulated Lighthouse results**. This allows you to:
- ✅ See the beautiful UI immediately
- ✅ Test the panel functionality
- ✅ Understand how it works
- ✅ Demo to your team

**Simulated data includes:**
- Random scores (70-100 for performance, 80-100 for accessibility)
- Random Core Web Vitals metrics
- Occasional failed audits for demonstration

### Production Mode (Future)

To use **real Lighthouse audits**, you need to:

#### Option 1: Backend API Service

Create an endpoint at `/api/lighthouse` that:
1. Receives: `POST { url: string }`
2. Runs Lighthouse using the `lighthouse` npm package
3. Returns: Lighthouse results in JSON format

See `.storybook/addons/lighthouse/README.md` for example implementation.

#### Option 2: Integrate with Lighthouse CI

Connect to your running Lighthouse CI server to fetch results.

## 🎯 Integration Options

### Easy: Keep Demo Mode
Perfect for:
- Demonstrations
- Understanding Lighthouse concepts
- UI testing
- Team presentations

### Medium: Add Backend Service
1. Create Node.js/Express endpoint
2. Run Lighthouse on the server
3. Return results to the addon
4. See real metrics in Storybook!

### Advanced: Lighthouse CI Integration
1. Connect to existing LHCI server
2. Fetch historical results
3. Show trends over time
4. Compare builds

```

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Colors

Edit `Panel.tsx`:
```typescript
MetricScore score={score}>
  // Change color thresholds:
  props.score >= 90 ? '#0cce6b' :  // Green
  props.score >= 50 ? '#ffa400' :  // Orange
  '#ff4e42'                        // Red
```

### Modify Thresholds

Edit `preview.ts`:
```typescript
thresholds: {
  performance: 90,      // Your threshold
  accessibility: 100,   // Your threshold
  'best-practices': 85,
  seo: 80,
}
```

### Add More Metrics

1. Update `LighthouseResults` interface in `Panel.tsx`
2. Add new sections in the render method
3. Update `simulateLighthouseResults()` in `preview.ts`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Panel doesn't show up
- ✅ Check: Addon is registered in `.storybook/main.ts`
- ✅ Check: Preview is imported in `.storybook/preview.tsx`
- ✅ Solution: Restart Storybook (`npm run storybook`)

### Audit button does nothing
- ✅ Check: Browser console for errors
- ✅ Check: Channel communication is working
- ✅ In demo mode: Results should appear instantly

### Want real Lighthouse results
- 📝 Follow the "Production Mode" guide above
- 📝 See `.storybook/addons/lighthouse/README.md`

1. ✅ View Lighthouse metrics in Storybook UI
2. ✅ Run audits with a single click
3. ✅ See beautiful color-coded results
4. ✅ Understand performance at a glance
