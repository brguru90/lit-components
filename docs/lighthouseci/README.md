# ✅ Lighthouse CI Server Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Your Project is Ready

**Project Name**: lit-components  
**Project ID**: bd32655b-1c89-4f91-8e24-1c005143bcbc  
**Build Token**: 39b86d35-a1d5-4aca-8189-f478eef60eac  
**Server URL**: http://localhost:9001  

## 📊 View Your Dashboard

Open your project dashboard:
```
http://localhost:9001/app/projects/bd32655b-1c89-4f91-8e24-1c005143bcbc
```

Or visit the main dashboard:
```
http://localhost:9001/app
```

## 🚀 Run Your First Audit

Now that the server is configured, run Lighthouse and upload results:

```bash
npm run lighthouse
```

This will:
1. Build Storybook
2. Run Lighthouse audits on configured URLs
3. Upload results to your local server
4. Display scores in the terminal
5. Show a link to view full results in the dashboard

## 📝 Configuration

Your `lighthouserc.json` is now configured to upload to the local server:

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "upload": {
      "target": "lhci",
      "serverBaseUrl": "http://localhost:9001",
      "token": "39b86d35-a1d5-4aca-8189-f478eef60eac"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Keep Your Token Secure
- The build token is saved in `lighthouserc.json`
- Add this file to `.gitignore` if you don't want to commit the token
- Or use environment variables:
  ```bash
  export LHCI_TOKEN="39b86d35-a1d5-4aca-8189-f478eef60eac"
  ```

### Server Management

**Start Server**:
```bash
npm run lighthouse:server
```

**Server Location**:
- URL: http://localhost:9001
- Database: `.lighthouseci/db.sql`
- Config: `.lighthouseci/project-config.json`

## 📈 What You Can Do Now

1. **Run Audits**: `npm run lighthouse`
2. **View Trends**: Track performance over time
3. **Compare Builds**: See how changes affect scores
4. **Set Baselines**: Mark good builds as baselines
5. **Share Results**: Send dashboard links to team members

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

```bash
# Terminal 1: Keep server running
npm run lighthouse:server

# Terminal 2: Make changes and audit
npm run lighthouse

# View results in browser
# http://localhost:9001/app/projects/bd32655b-1c89-4f91-8e24-1c005143bcbc
```
