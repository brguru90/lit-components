📊 Lighthouse Report for: Components/Button/Primary
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✓ performance       : 92% (threshold: 70%)
✓ accessibility     : 100% (threshold: 90%)
✓ best-practices    : 95% (threshold: 80%)

        'best-practices': 85,
        seo: 75,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Skip Lighthouse for Specific Stories
```typescript
export const LoadingState: Story = {
  args: { loading: true },
  parameters: {
    lighthouse: {
      enabled: false, // Skip this story
    },
  },
};
```

### Enable Detailed Reports
```typescript
export const CriticalComponent: Story = {
  args: { /* ... */ },
  parameters: {
    lighthouse: {
      printReport: true, // Print detailed metrics
      thresholds: {
        performance: 95,
        accessibility: 100,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 🎨 Example Stories

### Button with High Accessibility Requirements
```typescript
export const AccessiblePrimary: Story = {
  args: {
    variant: 'primary',
  },
  render: (args) => html`
    <vg-button
      variant="${args.variant}"
      aria-label="Submit form"
    >
      Submit
    </vg-button>
  `,
  parameters: {
    lighthouse: {
      thresholds: {
        accessibility: 100, // Must be perfect
        performance: 85,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Card with Performance Focus
```typescript
export const OptimizedCard: Story = {
  args: { /* ... */ },
  parameters: {
    lighthouse: {
      thresholds: {
        performance: 95,      // Very high requirement
        accessibility: 100,
        'best-practices': 90,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Chrome"
**Solution**: Install Chrome dependencies (Linux):
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libgbm1 libasound2
```

### Issue: "Port 6006 already in use"
**Solution**: Make sure Storybook is running first
```bash
npm run storybook  # Terminal 1
npm run test-storybook  # Terminal 2
```

### Issue: Tests are very slow
**Solution**: Skip non-critical stories
```typescript
parameters: {
  lighthouse: { enabled: false }
}
```

### Issue: Scores vary between runs
**Solution**: Configure multiple runs in `lighthouserc.json`:
```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "numberOfRuns": 3  // Average of 3 runs
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Verify Installation
```bash
npm list @storybook/test-runner lighthouse chrome-launcher @lhci/cli
```

### 2. Run Setup Test
```bash
./scripts/test-lighthouse-setup.sh
```

### 3. Manual Test
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run storybook

# Terminal 2
npm run test-storybook
```

### 4. Check CI Configuration
```bash
git status
# Should show .github/workflows/lighthouse.yml
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Set Realistic Thresholds**: Start lower, increase gradually
2. **Accessibility First**: Always aim for 100% accessibility
3. **Focus on Critical Stories**: Don't run on every variant
4. **Monitor Trends**: Track scores over time
5. **Use in CI/CD**: Catch regressions early
6. **Document Exceptions**: Explain why certain stories are skipped
7. **Regular Audits**: Run weekly or on major changes
8. **Team Education**: Ensure team understands metrics

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ `npm run test-storybook` runs without errors
- ✅ Console shows Lighthouse reports for each story
- ✅ Thresholds are enforced (tests fail if scores too low)
- ✅ Summary report appears at the end
- ✅ CI/CD workflow passes (if configured)

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Use watch mode during development**:
   ```bash
   npm run test-storybook:watch
   ```

2. **Test specific stories**:
   ```bash
   test-storybook --stories "components-button--*"
   ```

3. **Generate HTML reports**:
   ```bash
   npm run lighthouse
   # Check .lighthouseci/ folder
   ```

4. **Compare before/after**:
   - Run tests before changes
   - Make improvements
   - Run tests again
   - Compare scores

5. **Use environment variables**:
   ```bash
   LIGHTHOUSE_PRINT_REPORT=true npm run test-storybook
   ```
